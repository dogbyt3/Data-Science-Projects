This project is an example of using several classifier techniques to predict a discrete class.
For these examples we apply a Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Quadratic Discriminant
Analysis (QDA), and a Logistic Regressor.  The project consists of several adhoc experiments
within several files.  The purpose of each is listed below:
