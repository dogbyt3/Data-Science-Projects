This project is an example of applying evolutionary algorithms to solve
constraint satisfactions problems. Namely, for this example Knapsack problems
of optimizing weight and value.

  GA_vs_PSO_experiment.py:
    This experiment compares a Genetic Algorithm and a Particle Swarm Optimization
    method on randomly generated knapsacks.
