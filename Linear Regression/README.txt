This project is an example of simple linear regresssion on the UCIrvine Wine data set.  The project consists of several adhoc experiments within several files.  The purpose of each is listed below:
  experiment.py:
    This experiment uses Linear Least Squares (LLS) to examine the effect on error (RMSE) by altering the training/testing data     partition sizes using the red wine data set.
    
  experiment2.py:
    This experiment uses Linear Least Squares (LLS) to examine the effect on error (RMSE) by altering the training/testing data     partition sizes using the red wine data set to train a regressor, and the white wine data set to test the regressor.
    
  wine_quality.py
    This experiment uses Linear Least Squares to train a regressor on the red wine data, and then test the regressor on a testing data partition.
  
  wine_quality2.py
    This experiment uses Linear Least Squares to train a regressor on the red wine data, and then test the regressor on the white wine data set.
