# Data-Science-Projects
This repository is a collection of Data Science and Machine Learning examples
that I have developed over the years; some of them dating back to pre 2010.
Most of the examples are on small data sets that highlight the use of a
particular algorithm, or technology stack.  Some of the examples I have used
in brown bag talks, presentations, and some of them just for learning an algo
or stack.
